            <p class="text-lg mb-4">At a glance, this website The Yale School of Art is a graduate school that confers MFAs in Graphic Design, Painting/Printmaking, Photography, and Sculpture; and offers undergraduate-level art courses to Yale College students.</p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">Categories and subcategories may not always be clearly organized, making it difficult to find specific listings. This confuses the user and they might be unsure where to start, proceed, or focus their attention. So, systematic methods were used like interviews, personas, and heuristic evaluation in order to learn more about their opinions, experiences, and recommendations for enhancements.</p>
            <p class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Focus areas</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li> UI design: Design system, typography, visual layouts</li>

                <p class="text-lg mb-4">Design: I worked on the internal architecture

                    My work on the Yale School of Art website redesign is rooted in a deep appreciation for creativity, education, and artistic excellence. This project embodies an exploration of innovative design that embraces diversity and showcases the vibrant artistic community. By integrating elements of aesthetics, craftsmanship, and visionary thinking, the redesign aims to create an engaging platform that celebrates cultural heritage and inclusivity. Through thoughtful design solutions, I strive to enhance user experience while maintaining the school’s legacy of talent, education, and the pursuit of excellence. The outcome is a digital space that fosters connection, learning, and artistic expression for all.

                        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                            The colour palette, based on split complementary harmony, was chosen to create visual balance and contrast, relating to the Yale School of Art's mission of blending tradition with creativity. The base colour, brown (#7F5539), symbolizes reliability and professionalism, fitting for an academic institution. The complementary colours, blue (#39557F) and green (#397F6B), offer contrast while maintaining harmony. Blue represents trust and intellect, used for the text, while green signifies creativity and growth, applied to the artistic symbols. This combination of warm and cool tones provides visual interest and reflects the institution’s emphasis on both stability and innovation in art.

                        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                            Initially there was no logo and I added the globe as main element to make it more impactful. The globe’s shape was also geometrically adjusted to give the design a more modern, structured feel. The palette was added and placed next to graduation cap were signified to mention the art education.

                            By adjusting the thickness and simplifying elements, I ensured the design works well across various mediums.

                            I chose a strong sans-serif font like Montserrat for the logotype because of its professional and modern appearance, which complements the educational theme. The Helvetica lighter-weight tagline, “Empowering through Knowledge” adds a softer tone while reinforcing the logo’s purpose.

                            Before: "During exhibitions, Green Hall Gallery at 1156 Chapel Street is typically open to the
                            public but due to COVID-19, it will remain open only to the Yale community until further
                            notice."

                            <p class="text-lg mb-4"> Explanation: I rewrote this passage to enhance clarity and conciseness, aligning with the

                                    could be off-putting or confusing for users. The rephrased version is more direct and

The layout is well-structured, with the key information clearly organized and easy to read. The inclusion of the school's website address and Sai Rajesh Rapelli's role as the School Director suggests this is a formal business card used for official communication and networking.
                                This card would be a suitable addition to a professional portfolio, as it demonstrates a well-designed and informative business card that effectively conveys the necessary details about the Yale School of Art and its leadership.

                            <p class="text-lg mb-4">Instead of the column grid, I chose a manuscript grid for this redesign. The manuscript grid 
                            offers a unified, streamlined layout ideal for content-heavy pages, allowing users to scroll 
                            through information with minimal distractions. Additionally, this grid structure provides 
                            enhanced responsiveness, improving adaptability across various screen sizes and creating
                            a cohesive experience on different devices.</p>

                                    After designing the low-fidelity wireframes, I translated them into high-fidelity prototypes, ensuring a user-centered approach by incorporating the chosen color palette (#7F5539 and its complementary shades) and maintaining visual consistency throughout. The designs address user needs identified during research, with each screen tailored to specific personas. The homepage prioritizes an intuitive information hierarchy and streamlined navigation, while the user profile screen uses clean typography and card-based layouts for clarity. The search and filtering screen integrates dynamic filters and intuitive scrolling for ease of use. Feedback from usability testing of the low-fidelity designs informed improvements such as enhanced interaction feedback, clear affordances, and error validation. The high-fidelity prototypes are pixel-perfect and ready for development, adhering to responsive web design principles for seamless experiences across devices. Next, I plan to validate the designs through usability testing to refine them further and ensure they effectively meet user expectations.
