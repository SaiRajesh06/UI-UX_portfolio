            <p class="text-lg mb-4">At a glance, this website The Yale School of Art is a graduate school that confers MFAs in Graphic Design, Painting/Printmaking, Photography, and Sculpture; and offers undergraduate-level art courses to Yale College students.

                Categories and subcategories may not always be clearly organized, making it difficult to find specific listings. This confuses the user and they might be unsure where to start, proceed, or focus their attention. So, systematic methods were used like interviews, personas, and heuristic evaluation in order to learn more about their opinions, experiences, and recommendations for enhancements.

                <p class="text-lg mb-6">Through this project, I deepened my understanding of user experience design and research. Leading user interviews helped me develop skills in gathering and analyzing user feedback, which I then applied to create more user-centered design solutions.</p>

Through thoughtful design solutions, I strive to enhance user experience while maintaining the school‚Äôs legacy of talent, education, and the pursuit of excellence. The outcome is a digital space that fosters connection, learning, and artistic expression for all.

The base colour, brown (#7F5539), symbolizes reliability and professionalism, fitting for an academic institution. The complementary colours, blue (#39557F) and green (#397F6B), offer contrast while maintaining harmony. Blue represents trust and intellect, used for the text, while green signifies creativity and growth, applied to the artistic symbols.
                        This combination of warm and cool tones provides visual interest and reflects the institution‚Äôs emphasis on both stability and innovation in art.

The globe's shape was also geometrically adjusted to give the design a more modern, structured feel. The palette was added and placed next to graduation cap were signified to mention the art education. By adjusting the thickness and simplifying elements, I ensured the design works well across various mediums. I chose a strong sans-serif font like Montserrat for the logotype because of its professional and modern appearance, which complements the educational theme.
                        The Helvetica lighter-weight tagline, ‚ÄúEmpowering through Knowledge‚Äù adds a softer tone while reinforcing the logo‚Äôs purpose.

            <p class="text-lg text-black-600 mb-4">Typography plays a critical role in establishing the visual identity and usability of the redesigned Yale School of Art website. The redesign utilizes Montserrat and Helvetica for distinct purposes.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-black-600 mb-8">
                Montserrat is a modern, geometric sans-serif typeface inspired by urban typography in Buenos Aires. It is clean, versatile, and visually engaging, making it suitable for contemporary designs.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-black-600 mb-8">
                Helvetica is a neo-grotesque sans-serif typeface renowned for its timeless, neutral, and professional design. Its simplicity makes it one of the most widely used typefaces in design history.

Public access is currently restricted due to COVID-19. Updates will be provided as circumstances change."</span></p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600">Explanation: I rewrote this passage to enhance clarity and conciseness, aligning with the user-first focus. The original sentence felt unnecessarily wordy and buried important information. The improved version separates key details‚Äîwho can access the gallery and why‚Äîmaking it easier for users to quickly grasp the message. Additionally, removing "until further notice" eliminates ambiguity. Clear, actionable updates convey a more transparent and user-focused approach, following UX writing guidelines on providing information usefully without overwhelming the reader.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600">Explanation: This revision aims to enhance conciseness and clarity by removing redundancy and improving readability. The original text is too formal and verbose, which could be off-putting or confusing for users. The rephrased version is more direct and engaging, starting with an inviting tone that better aligns with the university's brand definition. It also separates the two types of admissions clearly, ensuring that users quickly find the relevant information.</p>

The design features the Yale School of Art logo, which includes an image of a globe, alongside the school's name and tagline "Empowering through Knowledge". The overall design is clean and professional, using a color scheme of brown, navy, and white.
                The layout is well-structured, with the key information clearly organized and easy to read. The inclusion of the school's website address and Sai Rajesh Rapelli's role as the School Director suggests this is a formal business card used for official communication and networking. This card would be a suitable addition to a professional portfolio, as it demonstrates a well-designed and informative business card that effectively conveys the necessary details about the Yale School of Art and its leadership.

            <p class="text-lg text-black-600 mb-8">For the redesign of the Home, About, and Apply screens, I focused on developing the experience specifically for a desktop site.

            <p class="text-lg text-black-600 mb-8">Instead of the column grid, I chose a manuscript grid for this redesign. The manuscript grid offers a unified, streamlined layout ideal for content-heavy pages, allowing users to scroll through information with minimal distractions. Additionally, this grid structure provides enhanced responsiveness, improving adaptability across various screen sizes and creating a cohesive experience on different devices.</p>

            <p class="text-lg text-black-600 mb-8">After designing the low-fidelity wireframes, I translated them into high-fidelity prototypes, ensuring a user-centered approach by incorporating the chosen color palette (#7F5539 and its complementary shades) and maintaining visual consistency throughout. The designs address user needs identified during research, with each screen tailored to specific personas.
                The homepage prioritizes an intuitive information hierarchy and streamlined navigation, while the user profile screen uses clean typography and card-based layouts for clarity. The search and filtering screen integrates dynamic filters and intuitive scrolling for ease of use. Feedback from usability testing of the low-fidelity designs informed improvements such as enhanced interaction feedback, clear affordances, and error validation. The high-fidelity prototypes are pixel-perfect and ready for development, adhering to responsive web design principles for seamless experiences across devices. Next, I plan to validate the designs through usability testing to refine them further and ensure they effectively meet user expectations.

            <p class="text-lg text-black-600">Working on the Yale School of Art website redesign has been an enriching experience that enhanced my understanding of user-centered design principles. Through this project, I learned the importance of aligning design decisions with user research and stakeholder feedback to create intuitive and impactful digital experiences. The process of conducting interviews, crafting personas, and performing heuristic evaluations deepened my skills in identifying user pain points and translating them into actionable solutions.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-black-600 mt-4">Developing low- and high-fidelity prototypes allowed me to refine my approach to wireframing, grid structures, and color harmony, ensuring consistency and accessibility. I gained hands-on experience in usability testing, which emphasized the iterative nature of design and the value of feedback in driving improvements.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-black-600 mt-4">Overall, this project honed my ability to balance creativity with functionality, fostered a deeper appreciation for accessibility and inclusivity, and strengthened my skills in collaboration and problem-solving within the UI/UX domain.</p>
